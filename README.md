create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes .focus on logging the key pressed and saving them to a file

This Python script implements a simple keylogger using the pynput library, which captures and records every key press on the keyboard. The core functionality is defined in the keyPressed function, which is triggered each time a key is pressed. When a key is detected, the script attempts to convert it into a readable character using key.char. If successful, the character is appended to a file named keylog.txt, effectively creating a log of all typed characters. If the key is not a standard character (like Shift, Enter, or Ctrl), it prints an error message but continues running. The keyboard.Listener class is used to constantly monitor key presses in the background. Once the script is started, it keeps listening until the user manually stops it, with input() used to keep the program alive. This tool demonstrates how input capture works at a low level and is often used in ethical hacking or monitoring applicationsâ€”but should always be used responsibly and with permission, as logging keystrokes without consent is a violation of privacy and may be illegal.
